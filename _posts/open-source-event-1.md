# NYLUG Open Hacker Hours
[Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/nylug-meetings/events/wmtxvqyzgbfc/)
I attended this event with the intention of witnessing what working with linux is like and what groups like this do. Also, they posted that there would be brief lightning talks, which I was looking forward to as well. Instead of actually being able to do either of those things, I wound up in a room of 7 people, 3 of which were from our Blockly group. 1 of them was also a kid who wanted to learn how to hack social media accounts. It was underwhelming at best. Apparently, the leader of the group/event didn't even come.
