# Week 3: Browser Extension Experience

## My Experience Creating a Browser Extension

It was interesting working with my team members. We had 2 much more experienced members, while another member and I had less experience. It was actually quite easy to work together. After we set up our repository, we created a group chat with all of the team members. Then, we considered meeting in person to work on the project together, but due to scheduling conflicts and the ease of working on the project remotely, we decided to commit our additions individually on our own time. Regarding design, people tended to make their own decisions, create code, and submit it on their own. However, people did message the group chat to ask for thoughts and suggestions. We communicated via FB Messenger.
