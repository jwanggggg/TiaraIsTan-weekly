# Week 4: Project Evaluation

## The Project I Chose
I chose Blockly because my roommate from 2 summers ago worked on this project while we were interning together. I remembered that she really enjoyed her team and her work and that the project was open-source, so I thought it sounded perfect to work on. Blockly is a Google open-source project that is a web-based visual programming editor. Similarly to Scratch, it uses "blocks" to outline code logic.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors? Not the most beginner friendly, lacks beginner friendly labels.__


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Maintainers respond quickly and helpfully.__


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)? It doesn't seem to be too friendly or unfriendly. People are casually direct, but everything is good-natured. To be fair, this is some of their full-time jobs, so I don't expect smiley faces and slang everywhere.__



__Do pull requests get reviewed? Yes, they get reviewed and tested thoroughly.__



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? Not really, probably since they are coworkers rather than independent contributers.__
