# Week 2 Blog Post

## What did I Contribute to the Group Project?
I contributed the initial template code, which ultimately became the function that replaces "the" with "MEME". I also changed the cursor from default to a png of the hand from the "NUT Button" meme.

## What is the State of the Group Project?
The group project is doing well and while we've changed course from our original plan of changing all instances of ":o" and "o:" to the "Surprised Pikachu" meme, we've also added a lot more than we originally intended. All instances of "b" are replaced with the "B Emoji", all instances of "the" are replaced with "MEME", all images on the page are replaced with a meme randomly chosen from 6 preset memes, and the cursor is now the hand from the "NUT Button" meme. The extension does work and while there is potential for growth, it can also be called a finished product.

## What did I Learn About GitHub
I learned how to look at issues and comment/close issues.
