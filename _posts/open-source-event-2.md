# Event Night: Lightning Talks & Talk Practice Night! @Metis
[Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/nycpython/events/258102775)
This event had some interesting, not so brief lightning talks. There was one particularly interesting one about comments in code, but the one that was related to open source had to do with graph databases. Someone named Seth Kaufman who is apparently associated with NYU gave a talk about an open source tool that he was working on that organizes data into graph databases. The neat thing was that it was able to take data from different data sets and combine them using machine learning. This event was a lot more successful than the previous one. There were 30 or so attendees and several speakers.
