# Week 10: Kevin Fleming
## My Thoughts on the Speaker
What I found most interesting and surprising was that there are actual full-timers at Bloomberg who spend all of their time not working on proprietary Bloomberg software, but working on open source projects. At first, it seemed a little generous, but after Kevin's talk, I understand that it is still in the company's best interests. Even so, I find it nice that people who enjoy open source are able to get full time jobs doing just that.

# Project Personal Progress
I've made progress on the RTL flyouts issue, in that the blocks are now right-aligned. However, I'm still working on a part of the issue where the blocks need to be right-aligned relative to the flyout when zoomed out a lot. That is what I will be working on next week.
