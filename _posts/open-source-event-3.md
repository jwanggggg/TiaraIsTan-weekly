# Open Source NYC May
[Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-NYC/events/258658427/)
These panels were quite interesting and it was interesting to hear people's journeys into working in open source and what the experience is like. I found it pretty rude when the man sitting in front of me deciding to turn the Q&A into his own personal panel time though. I found the suggestions about how to judge the company's perspective on open source pretty good. Conference travel budget was an especially neat tip in my opinion, since it can apply to more than open source. I had the privilege of attending GHC and Google Cloud Next last year and they were both really meaningful to me. Especially GHC, in which I was able to attend a lot of panels that spoke to me as a female software engineer. I also felt that their encouragement to the audience to speak in the future was comforting. While I probably won't be doing any speaking any time soon, it did open me up to the idea of it.
