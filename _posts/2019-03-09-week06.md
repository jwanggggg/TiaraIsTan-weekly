# Week 6: HFOSS

## My Take on HFOSS

I think such projects are actually harder to get involved with. While there is a greater motivating factor, the consequences of messing up can be much greater and much more intimidating to a first-time contributer. I would certainly saw that these kinds of projects bring more prestige to contributers, but it really does take skill and care to effectively contribute to such a project. I would love to be involved in such a project, but only after I have achieved more confidence in my skills and more experience working with open-source projects in general.
