# Week 11: Progress
## Project Personal Progress
As it turns out, the progress on the RTL flyouts wasn't actually progress. Also, we've realized that fixing this problem on categories and simple are two different problems. Also, while Jim worked on the categories side of things, I worked on simple. However, we've realized that the problem on simple is more of a problem with re-rendering instead of RTL. I'm currently trying to figure out how to access variables from other files so that I might resolve the re-rendering problem.
