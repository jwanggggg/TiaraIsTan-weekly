# Tiara Tan
### Junior at NYU
#### Major: Computer Science
#### Minors: Math & Web Development

## Short Bio
Hi! My name is Tiara Tan, hence the username TiaraIsTan. I'm studying Computer Science at NYU.
I was born and raised on Long Island, but both of my parents are from Taiwan. I go back fairly often and I would say it's one of my favorite places on Earth. If you ever go, I would definitely recommend Taipei if you're a fan of the city and Kenting if you're a fan of tropical areas like Hawaii. Both have very fun night markets, so I would suggest visiting night markets wherever you end up.

### Hobbies
In my free time, I have various hobbies that I try to get better at.
